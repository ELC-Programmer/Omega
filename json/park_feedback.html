<p>If you choose, here is an opportunity to review feedback on Jessica Park's executive interview.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Good morning. Thanks for meeting with us. How are you?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This is a simple, professional greeting.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">I don't want to take your time any more than I need to. I'm here to ask you some questions about your job and how things are going in Omega in general. Can we begin?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This opening, while seemingly polite, indirectly suggests that the consulting process is a nuisance and/or something that isn't valuable enough to justify much time. It's not a terrible opening, but it would be better not to take on an apologetic tone to begin the interview.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">You're the VP of R&D, right?  May I ask your name?
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question demonstrates a lack of preparedness and professionalism.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">How long have you been with Omega?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">Good question to use after the greeting. It's an easy question for her to answer and it provides appropriate background information.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What background experience do you bring to your position?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question will likely invite defensiveness and create a sense of distrust. Once that happens, the interviewee will be less forthcoming with information throughout the interview. Occasionally individual incompetence may be a legitimate issue. However, you should focus on understanding the organization and assessing the organizational dynamics long before assessing individual incompetence.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What does your department do?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This seems like a simple enough question. The problem is that it's too simple. Any consultant ought to know that an R&D department is responsible for development of new products. If you are looking for a more complex understanding of the R&D process, then add specificity in the question to allow for the level of specificity for which you are looking.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Omega is well-known for its innovation in both software and hardware. You're responsible for supervising both of these teams. How do you manage the two simultaneously?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This is a well developed and thought provoking question.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">How do you see your role in your department?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This is a relevant question that should elicit good background information.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">It seems like there might be a conflict between the innovation process, which is never-ending, and a commercial product that at some point must have a finish date. When do you know when R&D is done working on a product? Are you guided by calendar deadlines? Do you have some other way of making this determination?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">One critique that someone might make of this question is that multiple questions were asked. However, a closer look at the questions would indicate that the 2nd and 3rd questions are not really new questions, but simply questions intended to clarify the larger question of completing products. In that sense, it's fine and the topic area is thought provoking.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What do you see as Omega's competitive advantages?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">It's important to assess strengths as well as weakness in the company.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">We keep hearing that R&D has trouble meeting deadlines. That you're constantly trying to make last-minute changes to the product. Is that true?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">Accusational questions will result in defensive reactions and lead to a sense of distrust which may negatively impact the entire interview. Before questioning about challenges, be sure that you have already asked enough questions such that the interviewee feels that you have a solid understanding of how things work and that you can appreciate the difficulties of his/her job or department.  Also, phrasing of the question is important.  See the previous question to look at how a consultant could ask about the issue of meeting deadlines without alienating the interviewee.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What do you see as Omega's competitive advantages?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">It's important to assess strengths as well as weakness in the company.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">How open would you be to change the way you do things to accommodate the needs of some of the other departments?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">It's important to assess the organizations readiness for change as well as determining the likely resistance that can be expected.  This information will be helpful when thinking about how to implement changes.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Ok, so what are your problems?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">It is appropriate to look for areas of improvement after you have sufficient background understanding of how things work and what is working well. However, the question is overly vague and comes across as negative. Avoid words like "problems." Use more specificity in this line of questioning. For example, "What are some of the typical roadblocks to meeting established milestones?"</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What do you see as the main challenges your department faces?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This is a fairly non-threatening way to ask about the department problems. It's a bit vague, but if you honestly aren't sure of specific problem areas, it's an acceptable way of raising issues that will require follow-up questions.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What is your management philosophy?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This is not a damaging question; it's just not as helpful as some other questions. It might be appropriate to ask this kind of question as a follow-up if they have described a critical incident and how they handled or mishandled it.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Who do you think is responsible for the problems R&D have had in meeting milestones?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">Rarely is a single person responsible for organizational problems. Use questions to look for systemic or procedural reasons for why a department is underperforming. Cooperation will be limited if the perception is that the consultants are on some kind of "Witch Hunt."  Moreover, encouraging blaming behavior will likely be counterproductive to developing the kind of culture and sense of accountability necessary to implement initiatives of change.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What can be done in your department to help ensure that the product is released on time?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This kind of question works well after you have developed some trust with the interviewee. It also helps them look inward rather than blaming other departments.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">If you were in my shoes, what would you recommend Omega do?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This kind of question suggests that you need help doing your job. In phrasing the question, leave yourself out of it. Instead, you might ask, "Are there viable solutions that Omega hasn't used to address these issues?"</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What do you think should be done to improve coordination between departments at Omega?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question is simple and should provide helpful information. Even if they don't have any ideas, they will likely communicate their perceptions of other departments.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Does R&D have difficulties communicating with any of the other departments?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">The topic of the question is straightforward and simple enough. One critique would be that it is a yes or no type question. It's fine as long as you are prepared with some follow-up questions that are open-ended.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Why do you think the departments here have such a hard time communicating with one another?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question may or may not be appropriate. If it's a follow-up question based on an answer where they suggested that communication is problematic between departments, then it's fine. Without that foundation, the question would seem that you have pretty strong preconceived ideas.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">How is your relationship with the other executives?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question works well to introduce the general topic of inter-department relationships. More specific follow-up questions would be helpful.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">So what's the newest and greatest at R&D right now?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question may work as kind of an ice-breaker, but it's really off topic (of organizational dynamics). Also, it may put the person in the awkward position of telling you that they can't share that kind of information. So, it may or may not work as an ice breaker, but it won't yield the kind of information that you need in your analysis.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">How's morale in your department?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question is fine.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Who else in this company do you think we should talk to?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">As stated, this is kind of a strange question to ask unless you add some more detail. For example, you could add the following: "Who else in the company do you think we should talk to regarding the market strategy behind the development of new products?"  Or, this question is one that might be appropriate as a follow-up question when someone expresses that they don't know the answer to a question.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">What are you expecting from us in terms of consulting advice?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question seems more appropriate for the CEO.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">We heard there were some problems with faulty products when you launched the Dreamweaver system. Do you think that problem was in engineering, production, or quality control?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question encourages finger-pointing and blaming rather than looking for all contributing factors (e.g., time constraints, material defects, misunderstanding of design, etc). Perhaps simply rephrase the question as: "What factors may have contributed to the returns of some of the Dreamweaver Systems?"</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Some of the other executives we talked to seem to think that Omega's problem is that your department doesn't stick to the agreed-upon number of innovations. So are you to blame?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question sounds more like gossip than a genuine question. As such, it will only incite defensiveness and resentment. A better line of questioning might use the following questions: "Is there an agreed upon number of innovations for any one gaming system? In the event of a new breakthrough innovation, is it considered acceptable to include that new innovation even if it slows the project down? Do other departments share that understanding?"</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Why does the CEO spend so much more time at R&D than with the rest of the company?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">The question is fine, but the tone of voice as you ask it should not imply accusation of wrong doing. Instead, the tone should simply indicate curiosity.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Do you think that the CEO plays favorites with your department?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This question will invite defensiveness. You might simply ask: "Does the CEO support the work that you do in R&D? Does he also seem to support the work of all the departments?"</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">Your Software Design Manager tells us that innovation in software is where the future of this industry lies, but that all the attention is given to hardware in your company. Do you think that's true?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">It is important to respect confidentiality of interviewees. If interviewees feel that you will go tell everyone else exactly what they said, they may be less candid in their responses. Instead of attributing the sentiment to the Software Design Manager directly, you could simply reference industry trends.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">This has been very helpful. Is there anything else you think I should know?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">This is an appropriate and polite way to close.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">That's all. I think we're done.</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">See previous question for a more professional closing.</p>

<p class="feedback-window-question">That's all I need to know. Who do I interview next?</p>
<p class="feedback-window-feedback">See second to last question for a more professional closing.</p>
