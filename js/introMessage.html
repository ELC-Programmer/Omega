<p><b>Omega Systems</b></p>
<p>Omega Systems is a business simulation that involves the consulting process of organizational change.  The company designs and manufactures video gaming systems and software but has experienced some setbacks.   To help solve the problem, the CEO has called in consulting teams to conduct interviews, diagnose organizational problems, develop organizational change recommendations, and give a short presentation of those recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Interview Process</b></p>
<p>The company has made nine Omega executives, including the CEO, available.  You may conduct a 5 minute interview with each one in the order of your choosing.  First, you will be greeted by the CEO and given some background information.  Second, you will be free to choose which executive you want to interview.  For each executive, there is an available pool of approximately 25-30 established questions.  Since you will only have 5 minutes with each executive, you will need to carefully select the most useful questions from that pool. Once you click on a question, the executive will answer the question.  Please note that once the first question is clicked, the timer will start.  It is imperative to review all of the questions and plan your interview strategy before clicking on the first question.  Better interviewing will result in better data collection and ultimately, better recommendations.</p>

<p><b>Presentations</b></p>
<p>Your team will then make a short presentation (about 5 minutes in length) as if you were presenting to the CEO and executives of Omega Systems.  Please be prepared to answer questions related to your presentation.</p>

<p><b>Activity Rationale</b></p>
<p>Although Omega Systems is a fictitious company, the issues and challenges are consistent with those faced by real-life companies in high-tech industries.  This exercise is intended to allow you to use all of your knowledge learned in class to assist a struggling company. Good Luck!</p>
